## Overview

Through the **ACS**, I had an opportunity to explore AWS‚Äôs AI-related training and certification programs by enrolling in an 8-week program with **Lumify**. The course started on **10th March 2025** and concluded on **28th April 2025** with a final graduation event.

The program was primarily self-paced learning through online modules, and each week included live Q&A sessions to help students with any questions. Since I was also taking a Machine Learning unit in Semester 1, 2025, I already had a basic foundation in ML concepts. This program really helped me expand my perspective on **real-world use cases** and the **AWS tools and services**.

## What I Learned

Some of the key topics I covered in this program include:

- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning and AI**
- **Exploring AI use cases and applications**
- **Developing Machine Learning solutions**
- **Developing Generative AI solutions**
- **Essentials of prompt engineering**
- **Optimizing Foundation Models**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
- **Responsible AI practices**
- **Security, compliance, and governance for AI**
- **Amazon Q Business**

I really appreciated how the program connected technical concepts with practical examples of how businesses are using AI responsibly and effectively on AWS.

I had originally booked my AWS certification exam for 15th July, but a winter flu on the 10th had other plans. Since it was O-week and I was also volunteering on campus, I‚Äôve now rescheduled for 24th July and I‚Äôm feeling ready to tackle it with fresh energy üí™

## After the exam

I took the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam at a Pearson VUE center. The exam consisted of **65 questions** to be completed within **90 minutes**. Before and after the exam, there was additional time allocated for reading consent forms and completing a short survey.

Each question took me about 20‚Äì30 seconds to answer, so the overall time limit was more than sufficient. As a Computer Science student who had recently completed a Machine Learning unit, I found the difficulty level manageable, with many concepts already familiar.

### Exam Domains

According to AWS, the exam covers five key domains:

- **Domain 1**: Fundamentals of AI and ML  
- **Domain 2**: Fundamentals of Generative AI  
- **Domain 3**: Applications of Foundation Models  
- **Domain 4**: Guidelines for Responsible AI  
- **Domain 5**: Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions  

Due to copyright reasons, I can't share specific contents here. However, I highly recommend the **AWS Official Practice Questions** set if you're preparing for the test.

## About AWS Skill Builder

### üìò [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/)

I think it's worthwhile to elaborate on the AWS Skill Builder webpage. It offers **free** and subscription-based resources to help us prepare for AWS Certified exams.

You can access the free resources by clicking on any badges and selecting "Free" in the price filter.
While the free resources don't provide full access to premium features like official full-length practice exams or hands-on labs, they still offer many digital courses that are an excellent starting point for building foundational knowledge.
