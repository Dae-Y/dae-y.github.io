## Overview

Through the **ACS**, I had an opportunity to explore AWSâ€™s AI-related training and certification programs by enrolling in an 8-week program with **Lumify**. The course started on **10th March 2025** and concluded on **28th April 2025** with a final graduation event.

The program was primarily self-paced learning through online modules, and each week included live Q&A sessions to help students with any questions. Since I was also taking a university **Machine Learning** unit and following Andrew Ngâ€™s ML courses in Semester 1, 2025, I already had a solid foundation in ML concepts. This program really helped me expand my perspective on **real-world use cases** and the **AWS tools and services** that bring AI solutions to life.

## What I Learned

Some of the key topics I covered in this program include:

- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning and AI**
- **Exploring AI use cases and applications**
- **Developing Machine Learning solutions**
- **Developing Generative AI solutions**
- **Essentials of prompt engineering**
- **Optimizing Foundation Models**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
- **Responsible AI practices**
- **Security, compliance, and governance for AI**
- **Amazon Q Business**

I really appreciated how the program connected technical concepts with practical examples of how businesses are using AI responsibly and effectively on AWS.


## Whatâ€™s Next

One of the best parts is that Lumify supports access to the learning platform until **21st July 2025**, giving me extra time to revise and deepen my understanding after my final semester exams. Iâ€™ve already booked my certification exam for **15th July**, and Iâ€™m looking forward to getting the AWS Certificate!

Completing this program has given me more confidence to pursue AI projects and leverage cloud services like AWS to build scalable, ethical, and secure AI solutions.ðŸ˜„

Iâ€™m excited to continue my AI learning journey and apply these skills to real-world problems!
