## Overview

Through the **ACS**, I had an opportunity to explore AWS’s AI-related training and certification programs by enrolling in an 8-week program with **Lumify**. The course started on **10th March 2025** and concluded on **28th April 2025** with a final graduation event.

The program was primarily self-paced learning through online modules, and each week included live Q&A sessions to help students with any questions. Since I was also taking a Machine Learning unit in Semester 1, 2025, I already had a basic foundation in ML concepts. This program really helped me expand my perspective on **real-world use cases** and the **AWS tools and services** that bring AI solutions to life.

## What I Learned

Some of the key topics I covered in this program include:

- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning and AI**
- **Exploring AI use cases and applications**
- **Developing Machine Learning solutions**
- **Developing Generative AI solutions**
- **Essentials of prompt engineering**
- **Optimizing Foundation Models**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
- **Responsible AI practices**
- **Security, compliance, and governance for AI**
- **Amazon Q Business**

I really appreciated how the program connected technical concepts with practical examples of how businesses are using AI responsibly and effectively on AWS.


## What’s Next

I had originally booked my AWS certification exam for 15th July, but a winter flu on the 10th had other plans. Since it was O-week and I was also volunteering on campus, I’ve now rescheduled for 24th July and I’m feeling ready to tackle it with fresh energy 💪

## After the exam

I took the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam at a Pearson VUE center. The exam consisted of **65 questions** to be completed within **90 minutes**. Before and after the exam, there was additional time allocated for reading consent forms and completing a short survey.

Each question took me about 20–30 seconds to answer, so the overall time limit was more than sufficient. As a Computer Science student who had recently completed a Machine Learning unit, I found the difficulty level manageable, with many concepts already familiar.

### Exam Domains

According to AWS, the exam covers five key domains:

- **Domain 1**: Fundamentals of AI and ML  
- **Domain 2**: Fundamentals of Generative AI  
- **Domain 3**: Applications of Foundation Models  
- **Domain 4**: Guidelines for Responsible AI  
- **Domain 5**: Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions  

Due to copyright reasons, I can't share specific contents here. However, I highly recommend the **AWS Official Practice Questions** set if you're preparing for the test.


One thing I'd like to share is the

At the end of the exam, a message indicated that it could take up to **5 business days** to receive results. Fortunately, I received a **“Congratulations!” email just about 8 hours later** 🥳🎉

### Digital Badge Earned
