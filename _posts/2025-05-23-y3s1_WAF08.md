Notes from the summary of COMP3011 Lecture 11, and online resources.

## What is Deployment?

- Deployment means **putting your application somewhere others can access it**, typically over the internet or a private intranet.
- It's usually the final step after development and testing — though maintenance is ongoing.
- **Both frontend (client) and backend (server) apps must be deployed**.


## The Deployment Process

- Some code (e.g., React) needs to be **built/compiled** before deployment.
- Others like Python and JavaScript are interpreted at runtime.
- **Tests should be run before deployment** to ensure everything works.
- Tools like **CI/CD (e.g., Bitbucket Pipelines)** automate deployment as part of the DevOps process (development + operations).


## Traditional vs. Modern Deployment

### Traditional (1990s–2000s)
- FTP to upload website files to a server.
- Server runs PHP/Apache.
- Could be on a shared or dedicated server.

### Modern (2010s–2020s)
- Cloud platforms handle infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- Includes **containerization** and **"Anything as a Service" (XaaS)**.
- **Scalable**, **pay-as-you-go**, and easier dependency management.
- **Code, data, and software are separated** for modularity and efficiency.


## Cloud Providers & AWS

- Leading providers: **AWS**, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud.
- AWS is the **most common**, and this lecture focuses on:
  - **Deploying a React frontend** with S3.
  - **Deploying a Node.js backend** with Lambda.


## Assumptions for Deployment

- Two separate apps:
  - **Frontend**: React.js SPA
  - **Backend**: Express-based RESTful API
- Both managed via **Git** with deployment automation hooks.


## Deploying the Frontend with AWS

### **Amazon S3**
- **Object storage service**: stores static assets as objects in buckets.
- Perfect for static frontends like React apps.
- Priced per GB + data transfer usage.

### **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**
- Manages API keys and user permissions.
- Allows **fine-grained control** over AWS services.

### **Deployment Workflow**
1. Build the React app: `npm run build`
2. Log into AWS with IAM credentials
3. Upload compiled files to S3

> ⚠️ You pay for storage + user access traffic

### **Frontend Optimizations**
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN to cache files and speed up access.
- **Route 53**: Maps your custom domain (e.g., `something.com`) to the S3 bucket URL.


## Deploying the Backend with AWS

### Alternatives:
- **EC2**: Virtual machine setup (requires manual config)
- **ECS**: Docker-style containerization (runs on EC2)

### Preferred: **Serverless Deployment**

#### **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**
- Lambda runs your Node.js code **on demand**, only charging for runtime.
- API Gateway **routes HTTP requests** to Lambda.
- Use `serverless-http` to adapt your Express app to work with Lambda.

#### **Lambda Setup**
- Use a `serverless.yml` config file to define:
  - AWS region
  - Node version
  - IAM credentials
  - Route mappings

- After deployment, you’ll receive a Lambda URL (e.g., `*.execute-api.*.amazonaws.com`)
  - Use **Route 53** to assign a custom domain to this backend URL.


## Final Considerations

- This is just one approach — **AWS offers many tools**.
- **Security**: Only give access to those who need it.
- **Billing**: Monitor usage to avoid high costs or DoS issues.
- Use **Billing and Cost Management tools** in AWS.


## AWS Services Used

| Service     | Purpose                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3**      | Deploying and hosting static frontend assets              |
| **IAM**     | Managing AWS credentials and permissions                  |
| **CloudFront** | CDN for performance and caching                       |
| **Route 53**| Mapping custom domains to AWS resources                   |
| **EC2**     | Virtual machine hosting (manual setup)                    |
| **ECS**     | Docker container hosting                                  |
| **Lambda**  | Serverless backend execution                              |
| **API Gateway** | HTTP routing to Lambda functions                    |
