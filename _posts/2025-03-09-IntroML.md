1. AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

2. ML is a type of AI for understanding and building methods that make it possible for machines to learn. These methods use data to improve computer performance on a set of tasks.

3. Deep learning uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired. 

4. Generative AI is a subset of deep learning because it can adapt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning.


## Definition of Meachine Learning
ML is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically make and improve predictions based on data.


ML algorithms build a model based on sample data (training data), to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

ML is data-driven
ML models learn from “supervision" or “feedback" to predict better
