## Definition of Meachine Learning
ML is the study of computer algorithms that can automatically make and improve predictions based on data.


ML algorithms build a model based on sample data (training data), to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

ML is data-driven
ML models learn from “supervision" or “feedback" to predict better
