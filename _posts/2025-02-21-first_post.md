Welcome to my blog!
 ¬†
A special thanks to the author of **Minimal Mistakes**, <br>
whose theme‚Äîpowered by **Ruby** and **Jekyll**‚Äîmakes creating a static website both simple and enjoyable. 

I'd also like to acknowledge the helpful resources in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACzFIAOsfpM). ¬†

I hope this blog can serve as:  
- **A portfolio** of my projects and work.  
- **A repository** for quick notes and key takeaways from what I've learned.  
- **A diary**, capturing my thoughts and insights.  

It is a non-profit personal blog, but I will appropriately reference all my sources to maintain accuracy and integrity.
