## What is a Framework?  
A framework provides a reusable and standardized foundation for developing software.
It includes pre-written libraries, APIs, and tools to streamline development.
Frameworks emphasize efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.

In this unit, we'll explore web development frameworks including **Django**, **Bootstrap**, **Express**, **Node.js**, and **React**.


## Django Structure and Key Files

### Project-Level Files

- `__init__.py`: Marks a directory as a Python package.
- `settings.py`: Stores configurations like database, apps, middleware.
- `urls.py`: Maps URLs to view functions.
- `wsgi.py`: Entry point for WSGI-compatible servers.
- `manage.py`: CLI tool for managing the project.

### App-Level Files

- `admin.py`: Registers models to the admin interface.
- `apps.py`: App metadata and configuration.
- `models.py`: Defines database models.
- `tests.py`: Contains test cases.
- `urls.py`: App-specific routes.
- `views.py`: Contains request-handling logic.


## Django Architecture: Model-View-Template (MVT)

Django follows the MVT pattern (a variant of MVC):

- **Model**: Manages data and defines the schema (`models.py`).
- **View**: Handles application logic and returns responses (`views.py`).
- **Template**: Controls presentation using Django's templating language (`templates/`).

### Benefits of MVC/MVT

- Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- Clean separation of concerns for data, logic, and presentation.


## Models and Migrations

Models define database structure and relationships. Before writing a model, plan the fields (e.g., title, description, slug, tags). Use slugs for cleaner, SEO-friendly URLs.

After writing models:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

## Django Admin Interface

The admin panel is an internal tool for managing data. To enable it:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

Run the server and access `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```


## Templates and Dynamic Rendering

Django templates use control structures (`{% ... %}`) and variables (`{{ ... }}`).

Example view:

```python
def index(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'index.html', {'posts': posts})
```

Example template:

```html
{% for post in posts %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ post.description }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

You can extend templates using `base.html` with `{% extends "base.html" %}`.


## URLs and Routing

Django uses `urls.py` to route requests.

Project `urls.py`:

```python
path('books/', include('books.urls'))
```

App `urls.py`:

```python
path('', views.index),
path('<book_id>', views.detail, name='books_detail')
```


## Error Handling

- **404**: Page not found. Use `get_object_or_404()` to handle missing resources.
- **500**: Server errors.
- **400/403**: Bad request / Forbidden.

Custom error pages can be designed for production.


## APIs in Django

APIs allow systems to exchange data. RESTful APIs use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods. Django supports API development with frameworks like **Tastypie** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.

Tastypie simplifies exposing models as APIs and allows fine control over access.


## CSRF Protection

Django protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery via `{% csrf_token %}` in forms.

The middleware checks for a per-request token and blocks mismatches.

Use CSRF tokens when modifying or accessing protected data.


## Summary

- Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the MVT pattern.
- It simplifies CRUD operations, template rendering, routing, and admin interfaces.
- Key tools include migrations, templating, and REST APIs.
- Django promotes clean architecture and is well-suited for scalable, secure web development.
