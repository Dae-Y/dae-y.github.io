As a Computer Science student passionate about AI and Machine Learning, it was eye-opening to see how these technologies are being deployed in real-world cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise systems.

## Key Insights

- **AI-powered security**:  
  Google Cloud and Mandiant showcased how AI helps defenders triage alerts, detect anomalies, and automate incident response.  
  This shift from reactive to **proactive security** is a powerful direction for applied ML.

- **Responsible AI adoption**:  
  A recurring theme was governance, compliance, and ensuring **responsible use of AI**.  
  Guardrails such as data protection, IAM (Identity & Access Management), and runtime monitoring are critical.

- **Generative AI in practice**:  
  While attackers may try to exploit LLMs, current evidence suggests AI mainly boosts **productivity** rather than creating new cyberattack methods.  
  For defenders, embedding AI in SecOps accelerates **detection, runbook automation, and anomaly spotting**.

- **Web3 and emerging risks**:  
  Panel discussions emphasized that **Web3 inherits Web2 threats** but with higher stakes (e.g., irreversible digital assets).  
  This area highlights opportunities for applying AI-driven monitoring and resilience techniques.

- **Agentic AI & the future**:  
  Google introduced concepts like **Gemini-powered AI agents** for policy writing, anomaly detection, and autonomous SOC operations.  
  This aligns with cutting-edge research in **autonomous agents** and context-aware ML.

## Why It Matters for Me

This summit connected the theory I learn in lectures like anomaly detection, supervised/unsupervised learning, and NLP, with **real-world applications in cybersecurity and enterprise AI**.  
It showed how skills in ML, distributed systems, and cloud platforms are directly transferable to tackling industry challenges.

## Personal Takeaways

- AI is **not just a research topic**—it’s already reshaping how organisations manage risk and innovate.  
- Strong foundations in **ML, data governance, and security** will be critical for future careers in AI.  

It reinforced my interest in **AI/ML for security and cloud applications**, and motivated me to keep learning beyond the classroom.
