This is a full-stack blog management system built with a Node.js and Express backend, a MongoDB database, and a React.js single-page application frontend. This project was upgraded from a previous blog app, server-side rendered Pug application to a client-side rendered React application to implement a real-time notification system using Socket.io.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Passport.js, Joi, Bcrypt
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, React-Bootstrap, Socket.io-client, Axios
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose

## Thought process and approach
The primary goal was to upgrade a classic server-side rendered application into a modern, interactive, and real-time MERN stack Single-Page Application (SPA). The approach was centered on creating a clean separation between the backend API and the client-side React UI, while integrating a real-time layer for a dynamic user experience.

1. **Frontend Architecture: Migrating to a React SPA**  
   I decided to completely decouple the frontend from the backend, creating a pure client-side application with React. This approach allows for a faster, more fluid user experience without full-page reloads. I used **Vite** for the build tooling and **React-Bootstrap** for a responsive component library. The core routing was handled by **React Router**, with all routes defined in `frontend/src/App.jsx`.

2. **Component-Based Design**  
   To ensure the frontend was maintainable and scalable, I adopted a component-based architecture.
   - **Page Components (`frontend/src/pages/`)**: Each component, like `Home.jsx` or `PostDetail.jsx`, corresponds to a specific route.
   - **Reusable UI Components (`frontend/src/components/`)**: Components like `NavigationBar.jsx` and `PostCard.jsx` were designed to be reusable across different pages, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.

3. **State Management Strategy with React Context**  
   Different types of state required different management strategies:
   - **Local State**: Managed with `useState` for component-specific data like form inputs (e.g., in `Login.jsx` and `PostEditor.jsx`).
   - **Global State**: Managed with React Context API:
     - `AuthContext` ‚Äì Tracks login state and persists session info in `localStorage`.
     - `NotificationContext` ‚Äì Handles real-time notifications.
     - `PresenceContext` ‚Äì Manages currently online users.

4. **Real-Time Integration with Socket.IO**  
   A key requirement was real-time functionality. I implemented a centralized Socket.IO module on both the frontend and backend.
   - **Backend (`backend/sockets/index.js`)**: Authenticates socket connections with Express sessions. Tracks active user connections using `socketsByUser` to support multiple tabs and manage the "Active Users" feature.
   - **Frontend**: A single socket instance is created in `frontend/src/services/socket.js` and shared via `SocketContext`.

5. **Data Flow and API Communication**  
   REST API communication is centralized through `frontend/src/services/api.js` using Axios. Pages fetch backend data via `useEffect`, store in local `useState`, and re-render accordingly.


## Key Learnings

### React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)

This project solidified my understanding of core React Hooks:

- `useState` for local state
- `useEffect` for API calls and socket subscriptions
- `useContext` for consuming global contexts like `AuthContext` and `PresenceContext`

I also created a custom hook `useAuth` for reusing auth logic easily.

### SPA Routing with React Router

Defined the full routing structure in `App.jsx`. I created a `PrivateRoute` component to protect routes (e.g., `/new`, `/subscriptions`) based on login state via `AuthContext`.

### Full-Stack State Synchronization

Learned to synchronize state between the frontend (localStorage, Context), and backend (Express sessions in MongoDB). Used Socket.IO to broadcast session updates across tabs for real-time syncing.

### Real-Time Communication with Socket.IO

Built a real-time system by:

- Authenticating socket connections
- Broadcasting updates (`io.emit`)
- Reacting to events on the frontend (`socket.on`)

This powered both the live notification system and active user list.

### Component-Based Architecture

Migrating from Pug templates to React taught me the power of reusable components. By modularizing the UI into units like `PostCard.jsx` and `NavigationBar.jsx`, development became faster and cleaner. Integrating React-Bootstrap further streamlined styling and layout.


## Reflection
This full-stack React blog app was a very challenging yet rewarding project due to its scale and complexity. While I had previous experience with Django and simple Node.js applications using Pug templates, this project required a much deeper understanding of full-stack development. I had to manage extensive API integration between the frontend and backend and master core React concepts such as props, parent-child component relationships, and Hooks.

As a computer science student, I believe selecting this as an elective unit was an excellent choice, even though it is not one of my core subjects. I really enjoyed the entire learning journey. The professor's teaching style was particularly effective, instead of simply reading from lecture slides, he fostered a communicative environment and made a dedicated effort to ensure every student understood the fundamental concepts.

Building this application gave me a profound appreciation for why development work is often separated into specialized roles like frontend and backend. I now understand that as a web service grows in scale, managing the entire stack alone becomes incredibly difficult. This project highlighted the importance of a modular and separated architecture for maintainability.

While I recognize there's still much more to learn about React and other industry-standard frameworks, this experience has given me a strong foundation in modern web application architecture. It has been a valuable milestone in my growth as a developer.



## Extra notes RESTful APIs

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications, especially web services. RESTful web services are:

- Highly scalable  
- Lightweight  
- Easy to maintain  

They are commonly used to build APIs for web-based applications.

### HTTP Methods in REST

In RESTful services, HTTP provides several methods to manipulate resources. The most commonly used methods for data creation and modification are:


### **POST**

- **Purpose**: To **submit a new entity** to a resource.
- **Use Case**: Creating a new resource under a collection.
- **Effect**: May result in a new resource being created, or the server performing some action.


### **PUT**

- **Purpose**: To **update a resource**, or **create it** if it does not exist.
- **Use Case**: Full replacement of a resource at a specific URL.
- **Effect**: If the resource exists, it is replaced; if not, a new one is created.


### **PATCH**

- **Purpose**: To **partially update a resource**.
- **Use Case**: Modify only specific fields of a resource without replacing the entire object.
- **Effect**: Applies a partial change to the resource.

### Summary Table

| Method | Purpose              | Creates Resource | Updates Resource | Partial Update |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| POST   | Submit new data      | ‚úÖ               | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå             |
| PUT    | Create or replace    | ‚úÖ               | ‚úÖ (full)        | ‚ùå             |
| PATCH  | Update part of data  | ‚ùå               | ‚úÖ (partial)     | ‚úÖ             |
