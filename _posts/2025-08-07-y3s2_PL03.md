Notes from the COMP2007 Lecture, and online resources.


## Historical Context
- **1950s programming:** Fortran was successful but machine-dependent (IBM 704).
- **Need for change:** Desire for a machine-independent, universal language → birth of ALGOL.
- Developed by committee → lengthy discussions on what to include/exclude.
- **Main goal:** Create a standard usable across different machines.


## ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)

### Key Innovations
- **Machine independence** → portable code.
- **BNF (Backus–Naur Form)** used to formally describe syntax (~15 pages of rules).
- **Nested control structures** (not just nested loops).
- **Block structure & scope:**
  - `begin ... end` blocks define scope.
  - **Scope:** Where variables exist and are accessible.
  - **Static scope:** Known from reading code (compile-time).
  - **Dynamic scope:** Determined during execution (run-time).
- **Types of statements:**
  - Declarative (declare variables/types)
  - Imperative (perform actions)
- **No built-in I/O** in the standard → machine-specific implementations.
- **Syntax regularity:**
  - One meaning per symbol.
  - Assignment: `:=`
  - Equality test: `=`
- **Reserved words:** Prevent misuse (e.g., `if` can’t be a variable name).
- **No restriction** on variable name length.
- **Data types:**
  - Integer, real, boolean, arrays (with arbitrary index bounds, e.g., `-5..5`)
  - Strong typing.
- **Recursion** supported.
- **Parameter passing:**
  - Pass by value (copy)
  - Pass by name (substitution-like, late binding) — tricky concept.
- **Pointers:**
  - Variables holding memory addresses.
  - Could cause issues (dangling pointers, memory leaks).
- **Activation Records (Stack Frames):**
  - Contain info needed for a function call: return address, local variables, links to other frames.
  - **Static link:** Follows lexical scope (compile-time structure).
  - **Dynamic link:** Follows call chain (run-time order).


## Static vs Dynamic Concepts

- **Static scope:** Determined at compile time by code structure.
- **Dynamic scope:** Determined at run time by the calling sequence.
- **Static typing:** Variable type fixed at compile time.
- **Dynamic typing:** Type determined at run time (e.g., Python `x = 5` → int, then `x = 5.5` → float).


## Pascal

- Developed to **simplify ALGOL** → more beginner-friendly, effective for teaching.
- Still used today in some legacy systems.

### Main Features
- Single main program block.
- Readable, well-structured syntax.
- Supports nested procedures/functions.
- Various data types: enumerated, subrange, sets, records (like C structs), pointers.
- Control structures similar to modern languages.
- Parameter passing similar to ALGOL.

**Strength:** Clear, structured, easy to learn.  
**Weakness:** Can introduce complexity through deep nesting, multiple binding methods.


## Why ALGOL & Pascal Matter

- **ALGOL** = “grandmother of modern languages” — influenced C, Java, Python, etc.
- Features we now take for granted (block structure, scope, recursion, reserved words, strong typing) originated here.
- **Pascal** showed that simplifying a powerful language can make it more usable for teaching and structured programming.
