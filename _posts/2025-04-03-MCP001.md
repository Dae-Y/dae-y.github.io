## What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI models to connect to external tools and data sources seamlessly—without the need for extensive hardcoding. It functions like a **universal plug socket** for AI tools, enabling models to access resources dynamically.

MCP was first introduced in **November 2024**, but interest surged in **early 2025**, especially after **Cursor AI** introduced MCP, attracting widespread attention from developers and general users.

## Why is MCP Important?
Before MCP, integrating AI models with real-world applications required custom APIs, plugins, or frameworks—often complex and fragile. MCP simplifies this by providing a **standardized** approach:
- **No need for custom API integration**—just follow MCP’s format.
- **Works with any AI model**—Claude, GPT-4, open-source models, etc.
- **Enables modular AI systems**—AI agents can discover and use tools without manual intervention.

## How MCP Works
MCP is built on a **client-server model** and consists of:
- **MCP Host** (execution environment)
- **MCP Client** (AI model)
- **MCP Server** (data source)

MCP Servers provide functionalities like:
- **Tools** – Perform specific tasks (e.g., file access, database queries).
- **Resources** – Structured data sources.
- **Prompts** – Predefined instructions.
- **Notifications** – Event-based triggers.
- **Sampling** – Data retrieval mechanisms.

## Why the Sudden Interest in MCP?
Several factors contributed to MCP’s explosive adoption in 2025:
1. **Ease of Use** – Even non-developers can install and connect MCP servers.
2. **Open-Source Growth** – The GitHub repo has over **10,800 followers**, fostering rapid experimentation.
3. **Multi-Language SDKs** – Available in **TypeScript, Python, Java, Kotlin, etc.**
4. **AI-Agent Integration** – MCP is ideal for integrating AI agents with business systems and data.
5. **Multi-Turn Interaction** – AI models now engage in **complex, context-aware conversations** instead of simple Q&A.

## How MCP Differs from Previous Approaches
Before MCP, integration relied on:
- **Custom APIs** – Each tool required manual configuration.
- **LangChain/OpenAI Plugins** – These worked but felt like **stitched-together solutions**.
- **RAG Pipelines** – Required structured retrieval workflows.

MCP standardizes this, making AI tool discovery **dynamic**—models can find and use tools without hardcoding.

## Where is MCP Being Used?
MCP is already powering numerous integrations, including:
- **Filesystem** (local file operations)
- **Google Drive** (file access)
- **GitHub** (repo management)
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite** (database access)
- **Slack** (messaging and file search)
- **Google Maps** (location services)
- **Sentry** (bug tracking)
- **Puppeteer** (web scraping)

Additionally, an adapter enables **LangChain agents** to leverage MCP’s open server network.

## Conclusion
MCP is revolutionizing AI integrations by providing a **standardized, flexible, and open** way for AI models to interact with tools and data. As adoption grows, it’s set to become the backbone of AI-driven automation.
