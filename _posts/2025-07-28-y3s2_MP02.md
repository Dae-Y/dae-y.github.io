High-quality machine perception requires understanding **image formation**, anticipating **imperfections**, and applying suitable **processing techniques**.


## 1. Image Formation
- **Geometric Primitives**: Representation of points, lines, surfaces in 2D/3D.
- **2D Transformations**: Translation, rotation, scaling, affine, projective.
- **Projection Models**: Orthographic, scaled orthographic, perspective projection.
- **Camera Model**: Extrinsic (rotation, translation) and intrinsic (focal length, image center) parameters; pinhole camera model.
- **Lighting**: Inverse square law, point vs. area sources, reflection types (diffuse, specular, Phong model).
- **Digital Camera Pipeline**: Optics → aperture/shutter → sensor → ADC → image processing (demosaic, white balance, compression).
- **Factors Affecting Image Quality**: Aperture size, shutter speed, sensor characteristics, ADC resolution, sampling and aliasing.


## 2. Image Imperfections & Artifacts
- **Optical**: Lens distortion (barrel, pincushion, fisheye), vignetting.
- **Electronic**: Sensor noise (thermal, quantization), pixel corruption (salt & pepper noise).
- **Environmental**: Motion blur, shadows, low contrast, incorrect white balance.
- **Geometric Issues**: Perspective distortion, occlusion.
- **Mitigation Methods**:
  - Geometric correction for distortion.
  - Median filtering for salt & pepper noise.
  - Histogram equalization for low contrast.
  - Shadow avoidance/removal.
  - White balance adjustment.
  - De-blurring algorithms.


## 3. Image Processing Techniques

### 3.1 Point Operators
- **Pixel-based operations**: Brightness/contrast adjustment, color correction/transformation, gamma correction.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Redistribute pixel intensities for improved contrast.

### 3.2 Linear Filtering
- **Convolution** with kernels (3×3, etc.); border handling strategies (zero-padding, replication, mirroring).
- **Common Filters**:
  - Moving average (box filter).
  - Gaussian filter (weighted smoothing).
  - Difference of Gaussian (edge detection).
  - Sobel operator (edge detection with noise smoothing).
  - Prewitt operator (simple edge detection).
  - Laplacian operator (second-order edge detection).
  - Wiener filter (deblurring with noise consideration).

### 3.3 Non-linear Filtering
- **Median Filter**: Effective for salt & pepper noise; replaces pixel with median of neighborhood.

### 3.4 Morphological Operations
- Applied to binary images using structuring elements.
- **Dilation**: Expands object boundaries.
- **Erosion**: Shrinks object boundaries.
- **Applications**: Hole filling, boundary extraction, skeletonization, thinning/thickening.


## Key Takeaways
- **Preprocessing** improves data quality for later stages like feature extraction and object recognition.
- Choice of filtering or transformation depends on noise type, image content, and desired output.
