Short reflection of the COMP3011 Web Application Frameworks unit.

## Reflection

I really enjoyed this web app unit and the way it was taught. The course was very hands-on, focusing on building a functional blog management app and various lab contents. This practical approach helped me understand the complete structure of a full-stack web application. <br>

The unit also went beyond focusing on a single framework, allowing me to experience several different technologies. I gained a better understanding of modern full-stack deployment architecture using AWS services. Since I am currently studying for an AWS AI certificate and working on my capstone project, these DevOps concepts felt very familiar and useful. <br>

I would really like to thank Professor Sheik. He made a great effort to communicate clearly and address students' concerns during lectures.
