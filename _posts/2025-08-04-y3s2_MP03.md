The theory and practice of detecting edges and lines, including gradient computation, convolution kernels, noise handling, and the use of the Hough Transform for parametric line detection.


## Introduction
Feature detection in computer vision, progressing from points and patches to edges and lines. 

Features are **distinctive patterns** or **structures** in images that can be used for tasks like object recognition, scene understanding, and tracking.

## Edge Detection
Edges represent locations of rapid intensity change in one direction. They are useful for segmenting objects, finding boundaries, and identifying shapes.

### Key Methods
- **Harris Detector**: Extends from corner detection, detecting points where one gradient direction is strong and the other is weak.
- **Gradient-Based Methods** (Sobel, Prewitt, Difference of Gaussian, Canny):
  - Compute gradients in X and Y directions.
  - Calculate gradient magnitude: `sqrt(Gx² + Gy²)`.
  - Apply thresholding to identify edges.
- **Preprocessing**: Noise removal and smoothing to improve robustness.
- **Postprocessing**: Non-maximum suppression to thin edges and remove weak, unconnected edges.

### Popular Edge Detectors
- **Sobel**: Emphasizes edges using fixed convolution kernels for X and Y directions.
- **Prewitt**: Similar to Sobel but with slightly different kernel values.
- **Canny Edge Detector**:
  1. Gaussian smoothing.
  2. Gradient computation.
  3. Non-maximum suppression.
  4. Double thresholding.
  5. Edge tracking by hysteresis.

Canny often produces more accurate and meaningful edges than Sobel or Prewitt.

## Line Detection
Lines are special cases of edges, representing straight boundaries.

### Applications
- Shape detection (buildings, rectangles, checkerboards for calibration).
- Prior knowledge of line presence aids in recognition.

### Hough Transform
A classical method to detect lines:
1. Perform edge detection to identify candidate points.
2. Represent lines in polar coordinates `(ρ, θ)`:
   - `ρ = x*cosθ + y*sinθ`
3. Use an accumulator array to count how many edge points align for each `(ρ, θ)` pair.
4. Peaks in the accumulator correspond to strong candidate lines.
5. Work backwards to draw detected lines.

The Hough Transform is efficient for finding straight lines in binary edge maps.
