On this day, I completed the **AWSome Day Online Conference** and deepened my understanding of AWS cloud technologies.  
The three‑hour workshop highlighted the importance of cloud computing. I already rely on cloud platforms such as **Google Colab** for my machine‑learning projects, and the conference showed me just how broad the cloud ecosystem really is.
