A quick reflection of the AARP site visit on the 9th Wed, July.

## AARP Site Visit

During this semester break, I was fortunate enough to have the chance to join an organized visit to the **Australian Automation and Robotics Precinct (AARP)**.

Around 20â€“30 Curtin students gathered on campus before boarding a bus out to the AARP site, a massive facility covering over **51 hectares** dedicated to testing and developing autonomous and robotics systems.


## Brewhub and Connect Event

As part of the visit, we participated in the **AARP Brewhub and Connect** event, which brought together students, researchers, and industry professionals. The event featured presentations, live demos, and a guided tour of the precinctâ€™s impressive test beds and control facilities.


## Highlights from Industry Presentations

### UXMachines

Artur from **UXMachines** showcased their **CASA-verified drone safety app**, which utilizes mapping and real-time data to enhance drone operation safety and ensure compliance with aviation regulations.

We also got to see the actual drone they were using, including its components such as the propellers.


### Greenroom Robotics

Harry from **Greenroom Robotics** gave an insightful presentation on their work in **Maritime Autonomy**, focusing on:

- **Optical Radar** and sensor systems for vessel navigation
- **Maritime Operation Systems** that enable remote monitoring and control
- Algorithms that allow autonomous ships to handle signal loss by returning to pre-defined safe points or maintaining position while avoiding obstacles and giving way to other vessels

I found this particularly fascinating as a computer science student because it connects directly with algorithm design and practical applications of programming in autonomous systems.


### Sentient

Thomas from **Sentient Computing** demonstrated how they use **Virtual Reality, 3D animations**, and **Digital Twin** technology to solve real-world industrial problems and provide advanced training solutions.

It was inspiring to see how digital twins can accurately replicate complex physical systems for testing and simulation, showcasing the transformative impact of immersive technologies on industrial practices.

My father also mentioned that companies like Chevron and Shell use VR-based training to prepare engineers, significantly reducing costs associated with fly-in fly-out operations.


## Final Thoughts

This site visit was a fantastic opportunity to see how automation, robotics, and software engineering come together to solve real-world challenges. It opened my eyes to potential career paths in fields like maritime autonomy, drone operations, and virtual simulation.

Big thanks to the Curtin SAE team for organising this visit and to all the industry presenters for sharing their work and insights!ðŸ˜Š
