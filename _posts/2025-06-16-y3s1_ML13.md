Reflection of 
Notes from the COMP3010 Machine Learning assignment.

## Reflection

So far, I’ve really enjoyed this unit and the way it was structured. Thanks to the professor’s guidance and engaging delivery, I’ve developed a solid overall understanding of machine learning. <br>
I now have a clear picture of both supervised and unsupervised learning, including practical applications and foundational concepts.

This unit has sparked my curiosity and passion for the field. I plan to continue learning in this area and hope to contribute to AI technologies that can make a positive impact on the future. The hands-on labs, real-world assignments, and well-designed lectures have made this journey both meaningful and rewarding. 😄 <br>

Below are my handwritten notes, which I prepared to study for the mid-semester and final exams. <br>
They helped me internalize key concepts and reflect on what I’ve learned throughout the course:
