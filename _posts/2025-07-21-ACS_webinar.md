A short reflection on Webinar â€“ How to Get a Job in Engineering.

As a Computer Science student graduating in November 2025, I found this ACS webinar incredibly insightful. Rather than focusing solely on resumes or interview tips, it offered valuable real-world advice from professionals working across various engineering and technology roles.


## Insights
All the speakers were incredible, and I wanted to share a few moments that resonated deeply with me.
Qirat spoke about the importance of presenting our work, not just completing it. That struck a chord with me. I felt this during my first Hackathon last year with my Computing friends, where I saw how teams built solutions and beautifully pitched them using tools like Canva or Figma. It made me realise how storytelling is just as vital as problem-solving.

Chrisâ€™s words were especially comforting. Iâ€™ve been actively applying for internships and graduate roles since March 2025, but I havenâ€™t had a breakthrough yet. I was feeling a bit down and discouraged, but his talk reminded me to keep going and helped lift my spirit.
I also realised I havenâ€™t applied enough so far, Iâ€™ve only sent out about 20 applications. More than anything, I know where I need to grow: I definitely need more practice with video interviews ðŸ˜…


## Key Takeaways
Some key points I took down:
- Engineering spans more than just coding, project management plays a huge role.
- Explore opportunities beyond traditional roles, including consulting and cross-disciplinary fields.
- Industry readiness: Familiarize yourself with VS, Simulink, Git, Jira, Agile, V-model.
- Documentation and planning are just as crucial as coding.
- Success requires precision, purpose, and perseverance.


## Final Thoughts
This session reminded me that networking and persistence are just as important as technical skills. It was motivating to hear real-world advice from experienced professionals. 
A big thanks to the ACS team and all the speakers for sharing time, insights, and encouragement!ðŸ˜Š
