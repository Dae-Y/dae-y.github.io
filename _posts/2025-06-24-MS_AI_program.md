## What I Learned

During the program, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Conversational AI**  
  I learned how modern chatbots work as conversational experiences powered by trained Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. These are typically text-based systems that can query data through APIs or use techniques like grounding for more accurate answers.

- **Agents and Their Evolution**  
  We explored how chatbots have evolved into **agents** ‚Äî conversational assistants that use large language models and generative AI. These agents can automate tasks and help users in their daily work, often requiring little to no programming experience.

- **Copilot Studio Topics**  
  In Copilot Studio, topics define dialog flows that shape how the agent interacts with users.  
  - **Custom Entities**: These are categorized pieces of data that help agents understand and extract specific information from user input.

- **Live Demos**  
  The live session included a practical demo of building agents in Copilot Studio. I had access to a bootcamp test account, which allowed me to experiment with creating my own agent and try out different conversational flows.

## My Project: Simple GetNews Flow

## My Project: Simple GetNews Flow

Although my test account didn‚Äôt allow me to fully integrate Power Automate solutions with Copilot Studio, I built a simple **GetNews** flow in Power Automate to demonstrate how an agent can fetch and summarize information automatically.

### Step 1: Choose a Source API

I decided to use [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) because it‚Äôs simple and free for testing purposes. I created an account and generated my own API key.

### Step 2: Set Up a Power Automate Flow

Microsoft Copilot Studio works seamlessly with Power Automate to fetch and process data from external sources. I created a Power Automate flow that connects to NewsAPI and returns data for the agent.

**Create a New Flow:**

1. Log in to the [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/) website with your student account.
2. Click **Create** and select **Instant cloud flow**.
3. For the trigger, choose **When Power Automate is called by Copilot Studio**.
4. Give your flow a clear name, such as ‚ÄúGetNews‚Äù.

**Build the Flow Steps:**

- Use an **HTTP GET** action to connect to the NewsAPI endpoint, passing your API key and any query parameters.
- Add a **Parse JSON** step to extract specific fields (like headlines, descriptions, or URLs) from the API response.
- Use **Append to String Variable** to format the output text that your agent will display.

**Return Data to Copilot Studio:**

- Add a final action: **Return value(s) to Power Virtual Agents**, so your agent can display the news summary to the user.

This setup shows how you can connect external APIs to Copilot Studio using Power Automate, without writing complex code!

This was such a rewarding experience outside of my university coursework. The biggest takeaway is that **building agents and automating tasks doesn‚Äôt always require advanced coding skills**. With tools like Copilot Studio, we can build powerful solutions using natural language prompts, drag-and-drop actions, and prebuilt components.

I‚Äôm now inspired to create more advanced agents in the future. For example, I‚Äôd love to build an agent that automatically summarizes the latest economic news and presents me with key points whenever I start my day. That kind of **practical automation** would be an awesome productivity boost.
