A short reflection of Completion of Microsoft AI Skills for Students program.

## What I Learned

During the program, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Conversational AI**  
  I learned how modern chatbots work as conversational experiences powered by trained Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. These are typically text-based systems that can query data through APIs or use techniques like grounding for more accurate answers.

- **Agents and Their Evolution**  
  We explored how chatbots have evolved into **agents** â€” conversational assistants that use large language models and generative AI. These agents can automate tasks and help users in their daily work, often requiring little to no programming experience.

- **Copilot Studio Topics**  
  In Copilot Studio, topics define dialog flows that shape how the agent interacts with users.  
  - **Custom Entities**: These are categorized pieces of data that help agents understand and extract specific information from user input.

- **Live Demos**  
  The live session included a practical demo of building agents in Copilot Studio. I had access to a bootcamp test account, which allowed me to experiment with creating my own agent and try out different conversational flows.

## My Project: Simple GetNews Flow

Although my test account didnâ€™t allow me to fully integrate Power Automate solutions with Copilot Studio, I built a simple **GetNews** flow in Power Automate to demonstrate how an agent can fetch and summarize information automatically.

### Choose a Source API

I decided to use [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) because itâ€™s free for testing purposes. I created an account and generated my own API key.

### Set Up a Power Automate Flow

Microsoft Copilot Studio works seamlessly with Power Automate to fetch and process data from external sources. I created a Power Automate flow that connects to NewsAPI and returns data for the agent.

<div style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px;">

</div>
Click **Create** and select **Instant cloud flow**.

</div>
For the trigger, choose **When Power Automate is called by Copilot Studio**.

  <img src="{{site.url}}/images/2025-06-24-MS/flow_03.png" style="width: 550px;" />
</div>
Use an **HTTP GET** action to connect to the NewsAPI endpoint, passing your API key and any query parameters.

<div style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/images/2025-06-24-MS/flow_04.png" style="width: 550px;" />
</div>
Add a **Parse JSON** step to extract specific fields (like headlines, descriptions, or URLs) from the API response.

Use **Append to String Variable** to format the output text that your agent will display.

Add a final action: **Return value(s) to Power Virtual Agents**, so your agent can display the news summary to the user.

<div style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/images/2025-06-24-MS/flow_05.png" style="width: 550px;" />
</div>
After completion, we can proceed with testing.

This setup shows how you can connect external APIs to Copilot Studio using Power Automate, without writing complex code!

This was such a rewarding experience outside of my university coursework. The biggest takeaway is that **building agents and automating tasks doesnâ€™t always require advanced coding skills**. With tools like Copilot Studio, we can build powerful solutions using natural language prompts, drag-and-drop actions, and prebuilt components.

Iâ€™m now inspired to create more advanced agents in the future. For example, Iâ€™d love to build an agent that automatically summarizes the latest economic news and presents me with key points whenever I start my day. That kind of **practical automation** would be an awesome productivity boost.
