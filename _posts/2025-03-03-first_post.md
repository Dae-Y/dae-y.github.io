Welcome to my personal blog, proudly hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
A special thanks to the author of **Minimal Mistakes**, <br>
whose theme—powered by **Ruby** and **Jekyll**—makes creating a static website both simple and enjoyable.  

I'd also like to acknowledge the helpful resources found in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACzFIAOsfpM).

This blog serves as:  
- **A portfolio** of my projects and work.  
- **A repository** for quick notes and key takeaways from what I've learned.  
- **A diary**, capturing my thoughts and insights.  

I strive to appropriately reference all my sources, aiming to maintain both accuracy and integrity.  
This blog is a *non-profit project*—its primary purpose is:  
- To help me revise what I've learned.  
- To document my thoughts in an organized way.  
- To act as a resource for recruiters to review my work and skills.
