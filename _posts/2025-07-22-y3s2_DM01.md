Data mining bridges data and knowledge, combining **cleaning, analysis, and modeling** to deliver actionable insights in real-world applications.

## What is Data Mining?

Data mining (DM) is the process of **discovering insightful, novel, and understandable patterns or models** from large-scale data.  

Key points:

- We **mine knowledge**, not raw data.
- Closely related to **Machine Learning (ML), AI, and Statistics**:
  - **AI**: Simulates human intelligence  
  - **ML**: Learns patterns from data  
  - **DM**: Focuses on discovering knowledge from large datasets
- Applications:  
  - Market Basket Analysis (items frequently bought together)  
  - Fault detection from sensor signals  
  - Trend discovery in event logs
- **Challenges**:  
  - Data issues: Noise, missing values, corruption  
  - Knowledge issues: Limited domain expertise, ground truth  
  - Computing: Large-scale, distributed data, limited memory/power
- **Typical Process**:  
  1. Data Collection  
  2. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, feature extraction, selection)  
  3. Analytical Modeling (train, test, validate, deploy, evaluate)


## Basic Data Types

### 1. Nondependency-Oriented Data
Order of attributes/instances does **not** matter:

- **Quantitative Multi-dimensional Data**: Continuous numerical features (e.g., age, temperature).  
- **Categorical or Mixed Data**: Discrete labels, sometimes combined with numerical features.  
- **Binary / Set Data**: Yes/No or 0/1 attributes, common in transactions for association mining.

### 2. Dependency-Oriented Data
Order or relationships **do matter**:

- **Time-Series Data**: Sequential observations over time (e.g., temperature logs).  
  - *Contextual Attributes*: Timestamps that provide temporal context  
  - *Behavioural Attributes*: Measured values that change over time (e.g., temperature)  
  - *Multiple Attributes*: Includes several behavioural variables recorded concurrently  
  - *Example*: `(temperature, humidity, vibration)` recorded per second

- **Discrete Sequences / Strings**: Ordered symbolic data like event logs or DNA sequences. These are conceptually similar to time-series data, but with a key distinction:
  
  - *Contextual Attribute*: Timestamp or position within the sequence
  - *Behavioural Attribute*: Categorical value (e.g., event type, nucleotide) 
  - *Key Difference*: Categorical values instead of continuous numerical ones

- **Spatial Data**: Positional or movement data using coordinates (e.g., object tracking).

- **Network / Graph Data**: Entities represented as nodes, with relationships as edges (e.g., social networks, citation graphs).


### Common Data Formats

- **Tabular**: Rows (instances) × Columns (attributes), i.i.d.  
- **Time Sequence**: Ordered by timestamps  
- **Images**: High-dimensional 2D/3D arrays  
- **Text**: Unstructured, requires feature extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)


## Data Mining Tasks

- **Clustering** *(Descriptive)*: Group similar data (e.g., customer segmentation).  
- **Classification** *(Predictive)*: Predict class labels for new instances.  
- **Regression** *(Predictive)*: Predict continuous values (e.g., price prediction).  
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual patterns (e.g., fraud detection).  
- **Association Rule Mining** *(Descriptive)*: Discover items frequently co-occurring (e.g., Market Basket Analysis).


## Data Mining Methods

- **Supervised Learning**: Labeled data  
  - Examples: Decision Trees, k-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No labels, discover intrinsic structures  
  - Examples: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering
- **Association Rule Mining**: Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat  
- **Outlier Detection Methods**: Extreme value analysis, Histograms, Local Outlier Factor, Classification-based


## Application Scenarios

Data mining is widely applied across domains:

- **Retail**: Market basket analysis, recommender systems  
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, risk scoring  
- **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, patient clustering  
- **Manufacturing**: Quality control, process optimization  
- **Education**: Performance prediction, dropout analysis  
- **Cybersecurity**: Intrusion and anomaly detection  
- **Transportation**: Traffic mining, route optimization  
- **Social Media**: Web usage mining, opinion mining

### Notable Examples

- **Insurance Fraud Detection** – Identifying suspicious claims  
- **Netflix Prize** – Improving movie recommendations via hidden pattern discovery  
- **Structural Health Monitoring** – Outlier detection for abnormal signals
